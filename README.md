# LifeBox Simulator
An ongoing project for an evolutionary simulator made in Python.

The goal is to create a simulation game where different organisms are generated, each consisting of individual genes that dictate its behavior. These organisms will be able to eat, reproduce, evolve, and eventually die.

This is basically my first "real" programming project, so a lot of it will be far from perfect. But, hopefully, I'll improve it and my skills along the way.

(This is a test line btw)
